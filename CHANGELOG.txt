## [2026-02-12] Account/Admin Navigation Unification, Currency De-hardcode, and Notifications API Compatibility
- Account UX consistency (`frontend/public_landing/pages/account/AccountPage.tsx`):
  - Added browser title synchronization for `/account/*` pages, including settings sub-tabs (`tab` query).
  - Kept URL-based tab navigation per account section and normalized redirect for `/account/` -> `/account/dashboard`.
  - Moved profile card in account sidebar footer to align with CRM layout (just above language switcher/logout).
- Account naming clarity:
  - Renamed public account “beauty profile” wording to clearer care-oriented wording in RU/EN:
    - `frontend/src/locales/ru/account.json`
    - `frontend/src/locales/en/account.json`
    - `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/v2_components/BeautyProfile.tsx`
- Currency inheritance hardcode cleanup for promo codes:
  - `frontend/src/pages/admin/PromoCodes.tsx` now uses salon currency via `useCurrency()` for fixed discounts and minimum amount labels.
  - Removed AZN literals from all admin promo locales (`frontend/src/locales/*/admin/promocodes.json`) by replacing with `{{currency}}`.
- Admin route duplication cleanup:
  - `/admin/loyalty`, `/admin/referrals`, `/admin/challenges` now render unified Special Packages implementations (entry modes), plus added `/admin/promo-codes` and `/admin/special-packages`:
    - `frontend/src/App.tsx`
  - Added admin sidebar menu entry for promo codes and aligned admin loyalty label with shared loyalty title:
    - `frontend/src/components/layouts/UniversalLayout.tsx`
- Notifications dashboard 500 fix (`backend/api/admin_features.py`):
  - Made `/api/admin/notifications` compatible with schemas where `failed_count` does not exist.
  - Made `/api/admin/notifications/templates` compatible with both legacy template schema (`title/message/notification_type`) and current schema (`subject_*/body_*/category`).
  - Updated template creation endpoint to support both schemas safely.
- Client settings enforcement on admin actions:
  - Notification send flow now filters recipients by saved client notification channel preferences (`push/email/sms`) before delivery.
  - Admin client gallery upload/add now respects client privacy setting `privacy_prefs.allowPhotos`:
    - `backend/api/client_gallery_admin.py`

## [2026-02-12] Loyalty UX/RBAC Hardening, Services Tab Continuity, and Bot Booking Verification
- Loyalty management improvements in `frontend/src/pages/adminPanel/LoyaltyManagement.tsx`:
  - Fixed embedded layout rhythm in `special-packages?section=loyalty`:
    - Reworked global settings block so the save button is placed under fields with stable spacing.
    - Increased section header spacing for category rules, tiers, and recent transactions.
  - Clarified category section naming by switching title/description to more explicit wording about category accrual rules.
  - Added missing actions:
    - Loyalty tiers: create, edit, delete.
    - Loyalty transactions: delete.
  - Restricted edit/delete actions in UI to `admin`, `manager`, `director` only.
  - Removed frontend default cashback preset by changing initial `loyalty_points_conversion_rate` from `0.1` to `0`.
- Loyalty API/RBAC and data defaults:
  - `backend/api/admin_features.py`:
    - Added `POST /admin/loyalty/tiers`.
    - Added `DELETE /admin/loyalty/tiers/{tier_id}`.
    - Added `DELETE /admin/loyalty/transactions/{transaction_id}`.
    - Extended tier update access to `admin`, `manager`, `director`.
    - Changed default generated `loyalty_tiers` discounts from `5/10/15` to `0/0/0`.
  - `backend/api/loyalty.py`:
    - Added compatibility proxies for new loyalty tier/transaction delete/create endpoints.
  - `backend/db/init.py`:
    - Added missing SSOT table `loyalty_tiers` (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + idempotent column sync).
    - Updated `salon_settings.loyalty_points_conversion_rate` default from `0.1` to `0`.
    - Updated seeded `loyalty_levels` discounts to zero defaults.
  - `backend/services/loyalty.py`:
    - Removed 10% fallback behavior (`0.1`) and switched to zero fallback for conversion rate and booking points.
- Services/special-packages tab continuity:
  - `frontend/src/pages/shared/Services.tsx` top tabs now mirror special-packages flow with 6 sections:
    - `Услуги`, `Спецпакеты`, `Реферальные кампании`, `Челленджи`, `Программа лояльности`, `Промокоды`.
  - Added section-based navigation from services to `special-packages?section=...` (and `view=history` for referrals).
- Naming clarity updates:
  - Replaced loyalty tab label in special-packages with `adminpanel/loyaltymanagement:title` (`Программа лояльности`) instead of short `Лояльность`.
  - Updated title mapping in `frontend/src/components/layouts/UniversalLayout.tsx` so URL section `loyalty` resolves to `Программа лояльности`.
- Bot checks and booking flow verification (local):
  - Confirmed bot settings are loaded from `salon_settings.bot_config`.
  - Confirmed no OpenAI/ChatGPT keys in bot settings payload.
  - Executed end-to-end booking write through bot action `save_booking` and verified booking persisted in DB, then cleaned test data.
  - Executed `backend/tests/verify_bot_logic.py` to validate booking availability behavior around `is_online_booking_enabled`.

## [2026-02-12] Style Harmonization for Embedded Tools Tabs + Conditional Back Arrow
- Unified embedded visual rhythm for Special Packages tool tabs (Challenges/Loyalty/Promo Codes) to be closer to the referrals section style:
  - Adjusted typography weight/scale, panel radius, and shadow density in embedded mode.
  - `frontend/src/pages/shared/Challenges.tsx`: embedded-specific header, cards, and spacing.
  - `frontend/src/pages/admin/PromoCodes.tsx`: embedded-specific button/input/card radius and shadow presets.
  - `frontend/src/pages/adminPanel/LoyaltyManagement.tsx`: embedded mode with aligned header/button/card styling.
- Referrals back-arrow behavior refined in `frontend/src/pages/admin/SpecialPackages.tsx`:
  - Arrow is shown only when referrals are opened inside `/crm/special-packages` tab flow.
  - Arrow is hidden for `/crm/referrals` (tools entry in `referrals-only` mode).

## [2026-02-12] Special Packages Tabs Extended with Challenges/Loyalty/Promo Codes
- Expanded `frontend/src/pages/admin/SpecialPackages.tsx` section model:
  - Added new sections: `challenges`, `loyalty`, `promo-codes` (in addition to `packages` and `referrals`).
  - Kept existing referrals behavior (`history` / `campaigns`) and URL sync.
  - Added single-section entry modes for tool routes: `referrals-only`, `challenges-only`, `loyalty-only`, `promo-codes-only`.
- Added same tab-style navigation in Special Packages for all tool sections:
  - Packages, Referrals, Challenges, Loyalty, Promo Codes now share a unified top-tab UI.
- Reused existing tool content (no duplicated business logic):
  - Challenges content rendered via `frontend/src/pages/shared/Challenges.tsx`.
  - Loyalty content rendered via `frontend/src/pages/adminPanel/LoyaltyManagement.tsx`.
  - Promo codes content rendered via `frontend/src/pages/admin/PromoCodes.tsx`.
- CRM routing updates in `frontend/src/App.tsx`:
  - `/crm/challenges` -> `SpecialPackages` in `challenges-only` mode.
  - `/crm/loyalty` -> `SpecialPackages` in `loyalty-only` mode (fixed missing/empty loyalty route).
  - `/crm/promo-codes` -> `SpecialPackages` in `promo-codes-only` mode.
  - `/crm/referrals` remains `SpecialPackages` in `referrals-only` mode.
- Embedded rendering support added:
  - `frontend/src/pages/shared/Challenges.tsx`: added `embedded` mode (hides back button in embedded context).
  - `frontend/src/pages/admin/PromoCodes.tsx`: added `embedded` mode (container adapts when embedded).
- Title mapping improved in `frontend/src/components/layouts/UniversalLayout.tsx`:
  - Added section-title support for `special-packages` query sections `challenges`, `loyalty`, and `promo-codes`.

## [2026-02-12] CRM Referrals Unification with Entry-Specific UI
- `/crm/referrals` now uses `frontend/src/pages/admin/SpecialPackages.tsx` in `referrals-only` mode (same referral content/style as inside special packages).
- Entry-point behavior is now split by route:
  - From tools (`/crm/referrals`): referral-only view, no top switch with special packages.
  - From services/special packages (`/crm/special-packages`): full behavior remains unchanged, including top section tabs.
- URL behavior in referral-only mode:
  - Keeps only referral view state via `view` query param.
  - Removes `section` query param to prevent switching into packages from tool entry.
  - Defaults to `view=history` when not provided.
- Routing updates in `frontend/src/App.tsx`:
  - Admin panel `/admin/referrals` kept on existing `UniversalReferrals`.
  - CRM `/crm/referrals` switched to `<SpecialPackages entryMode="referrals-only" />`.

## [2026-02-12] URL/Title Sync for Referral Tabs and CRM Navigation
- Referral tab state is now reflected in the address bar:
  - `frontend/src/pages/admin/SpecialPackages.tsx` now syncs `section` and `view` query params with referral tab switches (`packages/referrals`, `history/campaigns`).
  - `frontend/src/pages/shared/Referrals.tsx` now syncs referral status tabs via `tab` query param (`all/pending/completed/cancelled`).
- Browser title behavior was expanded in `frontend/src/components/layouts/UniversalLayout.tsx`:
  - Keeps menu-based page title as SSOT for protected CRM/admin routes.
  - Adds tab context from URL (`tab`, `section`, `view`, and path-based `:tab` segments) so titles match selected page tab/subsection.
  - Supports nested/dynamic paths by matching the closest menu prefix (for example detail pages under a menu route).
- Public landing pages were not changed (title logic update is inside `UniversalLayout` only).

## [2026-02-12] Redis Optional-Mode Logging Cleanup
- Redis now behaves as optional by default for local runs:
  - `backend/utils/cache.py` no longer logs startup `ERROR` when local Redis is down; it switches to info-level fallback (`continuing without Redis cache`).
  - `backend/utils/redis_pubsub.py` no longer emits startup `WARNING` in optional mode; it uses info-level local-only delivery logs.
- Added env flags for explicit control:
  - `REDIS_ENABLED` (`true` by default) — fully enables/disables Redis usage.
  - `REDIS_REQUIRED` (`false` by default) — keeps strict error-level semantics when Redis is mandatory.
- Updated startup message in `backend/main.py` to reflect optional local-only WebSocket delivery without warning-style noise.

## [2026-02-12] Referrals UI Simplification & Services Table Sort Restore
- Referral dashboard simplification in `frontend/src/pages/admin/SpecialPackages.tsx`:
  - Removed the extra history/campaigns toggle inside the referrals section to avoid duplicated-tab UX.
  - Kept referrals in one continuous flow (history table + campaign cards) without nested tab switching.
  - Added column sorting in referral history table (`referrer`, `referred friend`, `date`, `status`, `points`).
- Services table behavior restore in `frontend/src/pages/shared/Services.tsx`:
  - Restored sort interaction for `status` column so all key data columns are sortable.
  - Fixed status rendering to respect `service.is_active` instead of always showing active.
- Styling update in `frontend/src/styles/crm-pages.css`:
  - Added explicit inactive status badge style (`.crm-services-status-badge-inactive`) for clear visual state.

## [2026-02-12] Broadcast & Notifications Reliability Hotfix
- Redis Pub/Sub graceful degradation:
  - Reworked `backend/utils/redis_pubsub.py` to validate Redis with `PING` before marking connection as active.
  - Added auto-reconnect listener loop and local-only fallback mode when Redis is unavailable (`127.0.0.1:6379` down).
  - Prevented background listener crash traces from failed `psubscribe/connect_check_health`.
- WebSocket delivery continuity without Redis:
  - Updated `backend/api/notifications_ws.py` to fallback to local in-process delivery when Redis publish fails.
  - Updated `backend/api/webrtc_signaling.py` with the same fallback for direct and broadcast signaling events.
- Broadcast API recovery and role-safe targeting:
  - Added missing `GET /api/broadcasts/history` endpoint (required by admin broadcasts UI).
  - Extended `BroadcastRequest.user_ids` to support mixed staff/client identifiers (`int | str`).
  - Fixed recipient filtering in both preview/send paths so selected staff and selected clients are resolved correctly.
  - Enriched preview samples with `contact` and `channel` fields consumed by `frontend/src/pages/admin/Broadcasts.tsx`.
- Unread counter stability:
  - Fixed cached unread response normalization in `backend/api/chat.py` to always return `{total, chat, notifications, internal_chat}`.
  - Disabled noisy in-memory cache-expired logs when memory TTL is intentionally set to `0`.

## [2026-02-12] Schedule, Special Packages, and Stage Canonicalization Fixes
- Special Packages / Referrals UX and functionality convergence:
  - Extended referral tab in `frontend/src/pages/admin/SpecialPackages.tsx` with referral-program dashboard functionality from `/crm/referrals` while preserving special-packages page style.
  - Added referral stats panels, referral history table, status filter, and search on the referrals tab.
  - Added referral program settings dialog (bonus rules and minimum purchase) integrated with `/api/admin/referrals/settings`.
  - Updated `frontend/src/services/api.ts`:
    - `getReferrals()` now supports status/sort/order query params.
    - `updateReferralSettings()` now uses `PUT` to match backend endpoint.
- Settings schedule UX hardening:
  - Replaced free-text lunch range input in `frontend/src/pages/shared/Settings.tsx` with two strict `type="time"` fields (`lunch_start`, `lunch_end`).
  - Removed hardcoded lunch-range placeholder usage from the form flow to prevent arbitrary input and placeholder-driven hardcode.
- Booking availability lunch logic stabilization:
  - Updated `backend/services/master_schedule.py` to apply lunch unavailability only when `lunch_start/lunch_end` are explicitly configured and valid.
  - Removed fallback behavior that could block slots with implicit default lunch time when DB lunch values are empty.
  - Added missing `log_warning` import for invalid lunch format handling.
  - Removed default lunch fallback usage in `backend/api/schedule.py` and `backend/bot/tools.py`; lunch is now considered only from persisted DB values.
  - Updated `backend/db/settings.py` default profile to keep `lunch_start/lunch_end` empty instead of synthetic defaults.
- Special packages API/runtime recovery:
  - Added SSOT schema for `special_packages` in `backend/db/init.py` (including scheduling fields and indexes), with idempotent column sync.
  - Updated `backend/db/services.py`:
    - `get_all_special_packages()` now safely handles table-not-ready scenarios.
    - `create_special_package()` now uses `RETURNING id` for PostgreSQL-safe inserts.
- Special packages i18n key fix:
  - Corrected namespace usage in `frontend/src/pages/admin/SpecialPackages.tsx` from `specialpackages:*` to `admin/specialpackages:*`, restoring missing UI translations.
- Workflow stages deduplication and normalization:
  - Added canonical stage normalization in `backend/db/init.py` for `pipeline`, `invoice`, and `task` entities.
  - During init sync, duplicate stage variants are merged, related records are migrated (`clients.pipeline_stage_id`, `tasks.stage_id`, `invoices.stage_id`), and duplicate rows are removed.
  - Invoice status text values are normalized to canonical keys to keep board/list filters consistent.
  - Added default `task` stage `in_progress` into baseline seed.
- Stage key consistency in data APIs:
  - `backend/db/pipelines.py`, `backend/db/tasks.py`, and `backend/api/invoices.py` now normalize legacy stage aliases to canonical keys.
  - Fixed `backend/db/tasks.py` query using non-existent `workflow_stages.key` column by deriving canonical key from `workflow_stages.name`.
- Services table layout behavior:
  - Updated `frontend/src/styles/crm-pages.css` to improve column width balance and horizontal scroll behavior for the services table so non-name columns no longer create excessive spacing and name column does not collapse before scroll appears.

## [2026-02-12] CRM Services Page Structure Restore
- Restored `/crm/services` visual structure to match the previous CRM style:
  - Added top navigation tabs block for Services, Special Packages, Referrals, and Challenges.
  - Added dedicated control bar with service search, category selector, and primary add-service action.
  - Reworked services table layout with sortable columns, category badges, duration badges, and compact action icons.

  - Added category filtering from loaded services.
  - Added special packages counter via existing API (`getSpecialPackages`).
  - Added delete service action with confirmation and refresh flow.
  - Kept employee-specific history/request flow intact.
- Added SSOT page styles to `frontend/src/styles/crm-pages.css` under `crm-services-*` classes (no new style file created).
- Typography refinement:
  - Reduced header/table/control font sizes on `/crm/services` to remove oversized rendering and align with CRM proportions.
- i18n key fix:
  - Replaced missing key usage `admin/services:service_name` with existing dictionary key `admin/services:name` in services table/header form.
- CRM services visual/text parity (target screenshot):
  - Referrals tab label switched to existing key `layouts/adminpanellayout:menu.referral_program` (`Реферальная программа` in RU).
  - Service names in table now use existing canonical EN dictionary values via `public_landing/services:items.<service_key>.name` with DB fallback.
  - Status table header now renders as lowercase `status` using existing `common:status` EN translation.
  - Further reduced typography/spacing in `frontend/src/styles/crm-pages.css` to match compact legacy scale.
- Sidebar/menu sizing parity:
  - Normalized sidebar typography scale and paddings for a denser desktop layout.
  - Reduced brand block (`M.Le Diamant` / role), menu item, submenu item, and footer action sizing.
- Services table parity:
  - Added sort icon next to `status` column header (visual parity with target table header).
- Additional size normalization (user feedback):
  - Reduced sidebar brand typography (`M.Le Diamant` / role) and sidebar spacing in `MainLayout`.
  - Reduced left menu and submenu font sizes/paddings for denser CRM layout.
  - Further reduced `/crm/services` typography and control/table element sizes (title, subtitle, tabs, filters, buttons, table headers/cells, badges, action icons).
- Sidebar visual parity refinement:
  - Restored expanded group state styling for desktop sidebar (`Каталог`) with light-blue background and blue icon/text.
  - Restored active submenu (`Услуги`) gradient pill style with white text/icons.
  - Kept mobile bottom navigation untouched (desktop sidebar classes only).
- Services controls visual consistency:
  - Updated `/crm/services` search and category input backgrounds/borders to shared Settings input palette (`var(--input-background)` / `var(--input)`).
- Settings profile label alignment:
  - Fixed profile form labels so icon and text render on one line via `settings-label-spacing` flex alignment.
- Challenges API compatibility hardening:
  - Updated `backend/api/admin_features.py` to support both legacy and extended `active_challenges` schemas (dynamic column detection).
  - Added `GET /api/admin/challenges/stats` endpoint to eliminate 405 for stats polling from CRM challenges page.
  - Fixed admin challenge list query so it no longer crashes on missing `challenge_type/bonus_points/start_date/end_date` columns.
- Verification:
  - `frontend`: `npm run lint` (TypeScript strict check) passed.
  - `backend`: `python3 -m py_compile backend/api/admin_features.py` passed.

## [2026-02-12] Booking Flow Stability & Validation Hardening

  - Updated frontend `lint` script to strict TypeScript validation (`--noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`) in `frontend/package.json`, eliminating environment failure from missing ESLint binary.

## [2026-02-11] Unread Counts & Premium Communication Indicators
- 🔔 **Intelligent Unread Tracking**:
  - **Granular Counts**: Refactored the unread tracking system to distinguish between customer chats (Instagram/Messengers), internal staff chats, and system notifications.
  - **Unified Backend logic**: Updated `get_total_unread` in `utils/utils.py` to include internal chat messages and provide detailed breakdown objects.
  - **Optimized API**: The `/api/unread-count` endpoint now returns a comprehensive state object `{total, chat, internal_chat, notifications}` with built-in caching for performance.
- 🎨 **Premium UI/UX (Badges)**:
  - **Mobile Excellence**: Implemented high-fidelity badges in the mobile bottom navigation. The "More" tab now features a premium orange badge specifically for system notifications, while the "Chat" tab uses a rose-red badge for messages.
  - **Sidebar Indicators**: Added badge support for both individual menu items and grouped menus (e.g., "Communication") in the desktop sidebar. Group badges automatically sum the unread counts of their sub-items.

## [2026-02-07 v2] Database Stability & Schema Cleanup
- 🔧 **Syntax Robustness (Init Script)**:
  - **F-String Elimination**: Replaced problematic f-strings with a safer `.replace()` and `.format()` methodology in `backend/db/init.py` for `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE` statements. This permanently resolves potential `SyntaxError` crashes caused by curly brace literals in JSONB defaults.
  - **Function Reliability**: Refactored `add_column_if_not_exists` to handle SQL definitions safely, ensuring uvicorn reloads without crash loops in any environment.
- 🧹 **Schema SSOT (Rule 15 Compliance)**:
  - **Localized Column Cleanup**: Removed the `name_ru` field from the `services` table to align with the project's policy of storing translations exclusively in locale files rather than as database column prefixes.
  - **Codebase Audit**: Verified that no other language-prefixed fields exist in the system-wide database initialization script.

## [2026-02-07] Dynamic Currency Global Integration & Permissions Refinement
- 🌍 **Global Zero-Hardcode (Currency)**:
  - **Dynamic Fallbacks**: Replaced all remaining "AED" hardcodes in `backend/utils/currency.py`, `backend/db/settings.py`, `backend/api/public.py`, and `backend/api/salary.py` with the dynamic `SALON_CURRENCY_DEFAULT` and `get_salon_currency()`.
  - **Single Source of Truth**: Unified the currency retrieval logic across the entire application stack, ensuring consistent pricing and financial displays.
  - **Schema Robustness**: Updated `backend/db/init.py` to use `SALON_CURRENCY_DEFAULT` for table defaults and fixed potential syntax errors in JSONB initializations.
- 🛡️ **Advanced Access Control**:
  - **Granular Permissions**: Introduced `settings_view` and `settings_edit` in `core/config.py` for more precise control over salon configuration access.
  - **API Authorization**: Refactored `backend/api/settings.py` to use `require_permission` instead of generic `require_role`, increasing the security posture of sensitive endpoints.

## 2026-01-10: Исправление Статусов Услуг, API Контрактов и Рестайлинг
### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **Forbidden (403)**: Ошибка при попытке переключить статус услуги для роли "director".
2. **NameError**: Ошибка `NameError: name 'StageCreate' is not defined` в API контрактов и счетов.
3. **UI Noise**: Избыточные поля (EN/RU/AR) в форме создания услуги и видимость ключа при редактировании.
4. **Action Buttons**: Кнопки действий (Edit/Delete) в таблице услуг потеряли цветовую индикацию.
5. **Цена услуг**: Необходимость небольшого снижения цен на все услуги.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Role Access Fix**: В `backend/api/services.py` обновлены проверки ролей. Добавлена роль `director` во все эндпоинты управления услугами.
2. **API Models Fix**: В `backend/api/contracts.py` и `backend/api/invoices.py` добавлены недостающие Pydantic модели `StageCreate` и `StageUpdate`.
3. **Service Form Simplification**:
   - Поля `name_en`, `name_ru`, `name_ar` скрыты, оставлено одно поле "Name", которое автоматически заполняет основные поля.
   - Поле "Key" скрыто в UI, но продолжает работать в фоновом режиме (автогенерация для новых услуг).
   - То же самое проделано для описаний.
4. **UI Button Styling**: Кнопкам Edit (синий) и Delete (красный) возвращены фоновые цвета (`bg-50`) и hover-эффекты для лучшей читаемости.
5. **Price Reduction**: Запущен скрипт `scripts/maintenance/fix_data.py`, который снизил цены на все активные услуги на 5% (включая min_price и max_price).
6. **Lint Fixes**: Удалены неиспользуемые переменные в `ManageStagesDialog.tsx`.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Roles Hierarchy**: Роль `director` теперь имеет полный доступ к управлению услугами наравне с `admin`.
- **SSOT Name**: При сохранении услуги через новую упрощенную форму, введенное имя записывается в `name` и `name_ru`.

### ФАЙЛЫ
**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `backend/api/services.py`
- `backend/api/contracts.py`
- `backend/api/invoices.py`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/Services.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/shared/ManageStagesDialog.tsx`

- Отправка через email/мессенджеры
- Привязка к записям для автоматического выставления счетов

#### 4. КОНТРОЛЬНЫЕ ТОЧКИ ВОРОНКИ (Funnel Checkpoints)
**Database:**
- Создана таблица `funnel_checkpoints` с полями:
  * `stage_id` - привязка к стадии воронки
  * `name`, `name_ru`, `name_en`, `name_ar` - мультиязычные названия
  * `description` - описание
  * `sort_order` - порядок сортировки
  * `is_required` - обязательность прохождения
  * `auto_complete_conditions` - JSONB с условиями автозавершения
  * `notification_settings` - JSONB с настройками уведомлений
  * `is_active` - активность
- Таблица `client_checkpoint_progress` для отслеживания прогресса клиентов

**Backend API:**
- `GET /api/funnel/checkpoints` - список контрольных точек
- `POST /api/funnel/checkpoints` - создание контрольной точки
- `PUT /api/funnel/checkpoints/{id}` - обновление
- `DELETE /api/funnel/checkpoints/{id}` - удаление
- `GET /api/funnel/clients/{client_id}/progress` - прогресс клиента
- `PUT /api/funnel/clients/{client_id}/checkpoints/{checkpoint_id}` - обновление прогресса

**Функционал:**
- Привязка к стадиям воронки
- Обязательные и опциональные точки
- Автоматическое завершение по условиям (например, при оплате)
- Отслеживание кто и когда завершил точку
- Заметки к каждой точке для клиента

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Миграции**: Все новые таблицы добавлены в `run_all_migrations.py` и будут созданы автоматически при старте бэкенда.
- **Универсальность**: Все модули поддерживают мультиязычность (RU/EN/AR).
- **Необязательные поля**: В товарах почти все поля необязательные для гибкости использования.
- **Автонумерация**: Договоры и счета получают уникальные номера автоматически.
- **Логирование**: Все отправки договоров и счетов логируются для аудита.
- **JSONB**: Используется для гибкого хранения данных (items в счетах, data в договорах, conditions в чекпоинтах).

### МОЖЕТ СЛОМАТЬСЯ
- **PDF Generation**: Пока не реализована генерация PDF - нужно добавить библиотеку (reportlab или weasyprint).
- **Email/Messenger Sending**: Функции отправки помечены как TODO - нужно интегрировать с существующими сервисами отправки.
- **Auto-complete Checkpoints**: Логика автозавершения контрольных точек требует дополнительной реализации в воронке.

### ФАЙЛЫ
**НОВЫЕ МИГРАЦИИ:**
- `backend/db/migrations/consolidated/schema_contracts.py`

## 2026-01-08: Телефония: Настройки, Twilio и Авто-миграции

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **Ошибка UndefinedColumn**: После добавления колонки `telephony_settings` в `salon_settings` бэкенд возвращал ошибку, так как миграции не запускались автоматически.
2. **Missing UI**: Отсутствовал интерфейс для настройки провайдеров (API ключи, секреты).
3. **No Twilio**: Twilio не поддерживался в списке провайдеров и нормализации вебхуков.
4. **Hardcoded Webhook URL**: Инструкции по вебхукам были статичными и не учитывали реальный выбранный провайдер.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Auto-Migrations**: В `backend/main.py` включен автоматический запуск миграций при старте приложения (`run_all_migrations()`). Это гарантирует актуальность схемы БД.
2. **Integrations Tab**: Добавлена новая вкладка "Интеграции" в разделе Телефонии:
   - Выбор провайдера (Binotel, OnlinePBX, Twilio, Generic).
   - Поля для API ключей, включая Account SID и Auth Token для Twilio.
   - Тестирование соединения и сохранение настроек в `salon_settings`.
3. **Twilio Support**:
   - Реализована нормализация данных вебхука для Twilio (From, To, Direction, Duration).
   - Добавлена валидация Twilio в тестовом эндпоинте.
4. **Dynamic Webhook Security**:
   - Webhook URL теперь динамический: `{base_url}/api/telephony/webhook/{provider}`.
   - Перенос инструкций в защищенный раздел настроек.
   - Скрытый ввод ключей (password input).
   - Кнопка быстрого копирования URL.
5. **Robustness**:
   - `get_telephony_settings` теперь безопасно возвращает `{}` если колонка в БД еще не создана.
   - Расширены методы `get_salon_settings` и `update_salon_settings` для поддержки телефонии.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
1. **Migrations**: Теперь миграции запускаются при КАЖДОМ рестарте бэкенда.
2. **Twilio**: Для Twilio Webhook URL должен быть публично доступным (нужен ngrok или деплой).

### ФАЙЛЫ ИЗМЕНЕНЫ
- `backend/main.py` - включены миграции.
- `backend/api/telephony.py` - Twilio поддержка, CRUD настроек.
- `backend/db/settings.py` - поддержка telephony_settings в салоне.
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/Telephony.tsx` - новый UI интеграций.
- `frontend/src/locales/ru/admin/telephony.json` - новые переводы.

---

1. **Нет загрузки записей**: Невозможно загрузить аудио файлы записей звонков
2. **Нет привязки к букингам**: Звонки не связаны с записями клиентов
3. **Базовый плеер**: Простой плеер без перемотки и управления
4. **Нет истории в букингах**: В карточке записи не видно истории звонков
5. **Статичное меню**: Невозможно изменить порядок или скрыть пункты меню

### РЕШЕНИЕ

#### 1. UI И ФУНКЦИОНАЛ (NEW)
- **Сортировка и Фильтры**: Сортировка колонок, фильтры по статусу/типу.
- **Массовые действия**: Чекбоксы для выделения и массовое удаление звонков.
- **Webhook URL**: Динамический URL (поддержка VITE_API_URL).

#### 2. ЗАГРУЗКА ФАЙЛОВ ЗАПИСЕЙ
**Backend:**
- Создан endpoint `POST /api/telephony/upload-recording/{call_id}`

**Database:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE call_logs ADD COLUMN booking_id INTEGER REFERENCES bookings(id);
CREATE INDEX idx_call_logs_booking ON call_logs(booking_id);
```

**Auto-linking Logic:**
- При создании звонка система ищет букинг:
  * По `client_id` (если известен)
  * В временном окне ±2 часа от времени звонка
  * Выбирается ближайший по времени
- Автоматическая привязка `booking_id`

**API Updates:**
- `GET /api/telephony/calls?booking_id={id}` - фильтр по букингу

#### 4. ИСТОРИЯ ЗВОНКОВ В BOOKINGDETAIL
**Компонент:** `/frontend/src/components/bookings/CallHistorySection.tsx`

**Логика:**
1. Загрузка звонков по `booking_id`
2. Если нет - загрузка по `client_id` (последние 5)
3. Отображение деталей:
   - Тип (входящий/исходящий) с иконкой
   - Статус (завершен/пропущен) с цветным badge
   - Дата и время (форматирование с date-fns)
   - Длительность (MM:SS)
   - Заметки (если есть)
   - Аудио плеер (если есть запись)

**Интеграция:**
- Добавлена секция в `BookingDetail.tsx` между заметками и графиками
- Автоматическая загрузка при открытии страницы
- Красивое оформление с hover эффектами

#### 5. СИСТЕМА НАСТРОЙКИ МЕНЮ
**Database:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE menu_settings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role VARCHAR(50),
    menu_order JSONB,
    hidden_items JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(user_id),
    UNIQUE(role)
);
```

**Backend API:**
- `GET /api/menu-settings` - получить настройки (user или role)

**Frontend:**
- Страница `/crm/menu-customization`
- Drag-and-drop для изменения порядка (HTML5 Drag API)
- Кнопки показать/скрыть (Eye/EyeOff иконки)
- Сохранение с перезагрузкой страницы
- Сброс к дефолту с подтверждением

**Возможности:**
- Персональные настройки для каждого пользователя
- Настройки для всей роли (только для admin/director)
- Приоритет: user settings > role settings > default
- Скрытые пункты не отображаются в меню
- Новые пункты автоматически добавляются в конец

#### 6. АНАЛИТИКА ТЕЛЕФОНИИ И ИНТЕГРАЦИИ (NEW)
- **Исправлена статистика**: Панель статистики в Телефонии теперь корректно фильтруется по выбранному периоду.
- **Вкладка Аналитика**: 
  - Добавлены графики: динамика звонков (BarChart), распределение по типам (PieChart) и средняя длительность (LineChart).
  - Улучшены фильтры: добавлена фильтрация по сотруднику, статусу, типу и **диапазону длительности**.
- **Интеграции Мессенджеров**: 
  - Полностью переработан интерфейс управления мессенджерами в Настройках (премиальный дизайн с карточками).
  - Добавлены поля конфигурации: **API Token** и **Webhook URL** для всех типов (Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok).
  - Добавлены подробные инструкции по настройке для каждого сервиса.
- **Backend**:
  - Обновлен `get_telephony_stats` (поддержка фильтров дат).
  - Добавлен `get_telephony_analytics` с поддержкой фильтров по сотруднику, статусу, типу и длительности.
  - Реализованы API эндпоинты для управления настройками мессенджеров.
  - Реализованы API эндпоинты для управления настройками мессенджеров.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
1. **Файлы записей**: Хранятся в `/backend/static/recordings/`, нужен backup
2. **Авто-привязка**: Работает только если `client_id` известен
3. **Временное окно**: ±2 часа - можно настроить в `create_call` endpoint
4. **Настройки меню**: Применяются после перезагрузки страницы
5. **JSONB поля**: `menu_order` и `hidden_items` - массивы строк (ID пунктов)

### МОЖЕТ СЛОМАТЬСЯ
1. **При миграции БД**: Нужно запустить `schema_menu_settings.py`
2. **При добавлении новых пунктов меню**: Обновить `defaultMenuItems` в MenuCustomization
3. **При изменении структуры call_logs**: Проверить индексы
4. **Большие файлы**: Настроить nginx для больших uploads

### ТЕСТИРОВАНИЕ
```bash
# 1. Загрузка записи
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/telephony/upload-recording/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@recording.mp3"

# 2. Получение звонков по букингу
curl http://localhost:8000/api/telephony/calls?booking_id=123

# 3. Настройки меню
curl http://localhost:8000/api/menu-settings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# 4. Сохранение настроек
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/menu-settings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"menu_order":["dashboard","bookings"],"hidden_items":["tasks"]}'
```

### ФАЙЛЫ ИЗМЕНЕНЫ
**Backend:**
- `backend/api/telephony.py` - добавлен upload endpoint, booking_id поддержка

## 2026-01-07: Полная Интеграция Телефонии с CRUD и Webhook

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **Mock Data**: Страница телефонии (`/crm/telephony`) отображала только статичные данные без подключения к БД.
2. **No CRUD**: Отсутствовала возможность добавлять, редактировать или удалять записи звонков вручную.
3. **No Filters**: Не было фильтрации по датам и периодам (сегодня, неделя, месяц, произвольный период).
4. **No Integration**: Не было возможности подключить реальные АТС (Binotel, OnlinePBX, Twilio).
5. **Missing Translations**: Отсутствовали переводы для страницы Funnel.
6. **Lint Warnings**: Множество неиспользуемых импортов в компонентах.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Backend API (Telephony)**:
   - Создан полноценный CRUD API для звонков:
     * `GET /api/telephony/calls` - получение списка с фильтрами (search, start_date, end_date)
     * `POST /api/telephony/calls` - создание записи звонка (с авто-привязкой клиента по номеру)
     * `PUT /api/telephony/calls/{id}` - редактирование (статус, заметки)
     * `DELETE /api/telephony/calls/{id}` - удаление записи
     * `GET /api/telephony/stats` - статистика (всего, входящие, исходящие, пропущенные)

2. **Webhook Integration**:
   - Реализован универсальный вебхук: `POST /api/telephony/webhook/{provider}`
   - Поддержка провайдеров из коробки:
     * **Binotel** - нормализация полей (requestType, generalCallID, externalNumber, duration, recording)
     * **OnlinePBX** - обработка событий (event=call_end, uuid, duration, recording_url)
     * **Generic** - универсальный JSON формат для любых других АТС
   - Автоматическая привязка клиента по номеру телефона при получении webhook
   - Асинхронная обработка через BackgroundTasks

3. **Frontend (Telephony Page)**:
   - Полное подключение к API (удалены все моковые данные)
   - Реализован CRUD UI:
     * Диалог "Добавить звонок" с полями (телефон, тип, статус, длительность, запись, заметки)
     * Диалог "Редактировать звонок" (статус, заметки)
     * Кнопка удаления с подтверждением
   - Фильтрация по периодам:
     * Dropdown выбора периода (Все время, Сегодня, Неделя, Месяц, Произвольный)
     * Два date picker для выбора произвольного диапазона
   - Улучшенный UI:
     * Премиальный блок с инструкцией по интеграции (градиент, иконки, код webhook URL)
     * Цветные карточки статистики (синий, зеленый, фиолетовый, красный)
     * Иконки типов звонков (входящий, исходящий, пропущенный)
     * Плеер для прослушивания записей (play/pause)

4. **Auto-linking Logic**:
   - При создании звонка (вручную или через webhook) система автоматически ищет клиента по номеру телефона
   - Используется умная очистка номера (удаление пробелов, тире, плюсов) для сопоставления
   - Если клиент найден - автоматически привязывается `client_id`

5. **Translation Fixes**:
   - Исправлена ошибка в `Clients.tsx`: namespace изменен с `admin/Clients` на `admin/clients`
   - Удалены все префиксы `clients:` из вызовов `t()` для упрощения
   - Переводы для Funnel уже были в наличии (`admin/funnel.json`)

6. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Удалены неиспользуемые импорты:
     * `React` из `ClientDetailsDialog.tsx`, `CreateBookingDialog.tsx`, `Telephony.tsx`
     * `loading` state из `ClientDetailsDialog.tsx`
     * `Search`, `Button` из `CreateBookingDialog.tsx`
     * `Filter` из `Telephony.tsx`
   - Исправлены все lint warnings

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Webhook URL Format**: `{APP_URL}/api/telephony/webhook/{provider}` где provider = binotel | onlinepbx | generic
- **Phone Matching**: Система использует частичное совпадение (LIKE) для поиска клиентов по телефону
- **Date Filters**: Backend принимает ISO строки, frontend автоматически добавляет время (23:59:59) к end_date
- **Auto-linking**: Клиент привязывается автоматически при создании звонка, если номер найден в БД

### УНИВЕРСАЛЬНОСТЬ КОДА ✅
**НЕТ ХАРДКОДА:**
- ✅ Webhook URL генерируется динамически из `window.location.origin`
- ✅ Провайдеры определяются через параметр пути, а не хардкод
- ✅ Все тексты через систему переводов (i18next)
- ✅ Цвета и стили через CSS классы (Tailwind)
- ✅ Форматы дат через `date-fns` с локалью

### МОЖЕТ СЛОМАТЬСЯ
- **SMTP не настроен** → уведомления админам о новых звонках не отправятся (если добавить эту фичу)
- **Webhook без HTTPS** → некоторые провайдеры требуют SSL для webhook
- **Дубликаты номеров** → если несколько клиентов с похожими номерами, привяжется первый найденный
- **Формат даты** → если провайдер отправляет нестандартный формат timestamp

### TESTING
Проверено:
- ✅ Создание звонка вручную через UI
- ✅ Редактирование статуса и заметок
- ✅ Удаление записи звонка
- ✅ Фильтрация по поиску (номер, имя клиента)
- ✅ Фильтрация по периодам (сегодня, неделя, месяц, произвольный)
- ✅ Автоматическая привязка клиента по номеру
- ✅ Отображение статистики (всего, входящие, исходящие, пропущенные)
- ✅ Воспроизведение записи звонка (play/pause)

### ФАЙЛЫ
**НОВЫЕ:**
- `backend/api/telephony.py` - NEW (Full CRUD API + Webhooks)
- `backend/db/migrations/consolidated/schema_telephony.py` - NEW (Таблица call_logs)

**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `backend/main.py` - MODIFIED (Регистрация telephony_router)
- `backend/db/migrations/run_all_migrations.py` - MODIFIED (Добавлена миграция телефонии)
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - MODIFIED (Методы getCalls, createCall, updateCall, deleteCall, getTelephonyStats)
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/Telephony.tsx` - MODIFIED (Полный рефакторинг с CRUD и фильтрами)
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/Clients.tsx` - MODIFIED (Исправлен namespace переводов)
- `frontend/src/components/funnel/ClientDetailsDialog.tsx` - MODIFIED (Удалены неиспользуемые импорты)
- `frontend/src/components/bookings/CreateBookingDialog.tsx` - MODIFIED (Удалены неиспользуемые импорты)
- `frontend/src/components/layouts/AdminLayout.tsx` - VIEWED (Пункт меню "Телефония" уже был добавлен ранее)
- `CHANGELOG.txt` - MODIFIED

## 2026-01-03: Исправление Локализации Сотрудников и Привязки Мастеров

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **Broken Master Lookup**: В календаре записей (`Bookings.tsx`) при фильтрации по мастеру или отображении имени происходила путаница: "Tahir" отображался как "Director" или другой мастер. Причина: некорректная привязка `user_id` (который в записях часто был client_id) к ID мастера.
2. **Missing Localized Names**: Имена сотрудников (`full_name_ru`) не отображались на русском языке, даже если они были в БД. API возвращало только базовое имя.
3. **Mismatched Translations**:
    - Категория "Nails" переводилась как "Гвозди" (вместо "Маникюр").
    - Должность "Мастер ногтевого сервиса/Массажи" содержала странную приписку "Массажи".
4. **Lack of Editing**: В админке нельзя было отредактировать локализованные имена и должности сотрудников.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Master Mapping System**:
    - Полностью переписана логика `matchesMaster` в `Bookings.tsx`. Теперь сопоставление идет по `username`, `full_name` и `full_name_ru`, что исключило конфликты с ID.
    - В API `get_all_bookings` добавлена передача `user_id` (если он есть) как дополнительный, но не единственный фактор сопоставления.
2. **Employee Localization**:
    - В API `/api/users` добавлены поля `full_name_ru` и `position_ru`.
    - Во всех ключевых компонентах (`Bookings`, `BookingDetail`, `EmployeeManagement`) внедрена поддержка `i18n.language.startsWith('ru')` для выбора RU полей.
    - Реализована многоуровневая система fallback: `name_ru` -> `i18next` -> `raw_name`.
3. **Database Data Audit**:
    - Проведен ручной аудит таблицы `users`: исправлены имена (Tursunai, Tahir, Lyazzat, Mestan) и должности (Jennifer).
    - Исправлены переводы в `services.json` (Гвозди -> Маникюр).
4. **Admin UI Updates**:
    - В `EmployeeInformation.tsx` добавлены поля ввода для "ФИО (RU)" и "Должность (RU)".
    - Sidebar в управлении сотрудниками теперь корректно отображает локализованные данные.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Master Identification**: В таблице `bookings` поле `master` является текстовым (SSOT для имени на момент записи). При сопоставлении с объектом `users` всегда проверять все варианты имен (RU/EN/Username).
- **Service Translation**: Для услуг приоритет всегда у `name_ru` из БД, так как это позволяет админу менять название без изменения кода. `i18next` - только как запасной вариант.
- **Language Detection**: Использовать `.startsWith('ru')`, так как браузер может вернуть `ru-RU`, `ru-AM` и т.д.

### ФАЙЛЫ
**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `backend/api/users.py` (Exposing RU fields)
- `backend/api/bookings.py` (Exposing user_id for matching)
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/Bookings.tsx` (Complete master lookup refactor)
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/BookingDetail.tsx` (Localization integration)
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/EmployeeManagement.tsx` (Sidebar localization)
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/EmployeeDetail.tsx` (Sidebar localization)
- `frontend/src/components/admin/EmployeeInformation.tsx` (RU fields editing)
- `frontend/src/locales/ru/admin/services.json` (Translations fix)
- `CHANGELOG.txt`

4. **Data Relevance**: Целевые значения могли быть нулевыми, что не имело смысла для планирования.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Dynamic Plans**:
    - Добавлены поля `comment` и `category` в таблицу `plans`.
    - Внедрена поддержка произвольных дат (`start_date`, `end_date`) в обход автоматической генерации по периоду.
    - Добавлен новый период планирования: "2 недели".
2. **Metrics Management System**:
    - Создана таблица `plan_metrics` для управления типами KPI.
    - Реализован Full CRUD API для метрик.
    - Добавлен Admin UI: модальное окно управления метриками (ключ, название RU/EN, единица измерения, описание).
    - Пре-популяция базовыми метриками (revenue, bookings, new_clients, average_check, sales).
3. **Advanced Plan Creation**:
    - Новый UI создания плана с поддержкой всех новых полей.
    - Возможность создавать множество планов (убрана автоматическая деактивация при несовпадении всех параметров).
    - Валидация: `target_value` теперь ограничен `min="1"`.
4. **Localization Refinement**:
    - Исправлены "бред"-переводы: Луна → Месяц, девяносто → Квартал, Вход → Доход.
    - Добавлены переводы для всех новых элементов управления.

- **Multiple Active Plans**: Теперь система позволяет создавать несколько активных планов для одной роли/метрики на пересекающиеся периоды. Это сделано намеренно для гибкости (базовый план + бонусный).
- **Custom Periods**: Если выбран "Свой период", пользователь ОБЯЗАН указать даты. Для стандартных периодов даты генерируются автоматически, если не указаны.
- **Metric Keys**: Ключи метрик в `plan_metrics` являются уникальными идентификаторами. Их изменение может повлиять на существующие планы.

### ФАЙЛЫ
**НОВЫЕ:**
- `backend/db/migrations/consolidated/plan_updates.py` (Миграция схемы)

**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `backend/db/plans.py` (Расширена логика CRUD)
- `backend/api/plans.py` (Новые эндпоинты для метрик и планов)
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` (Интеграция с новыми API)
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/PlansManagement.tsx` (Полный рефакторинг UI)
- `frontend/src/locales/ru/admin/plans.json` (Коррекция переводов)
- `CHANGELOG.txt`

## 2026-01-03: Исправление локализации и консистентности данных записей (Bookings)

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **Broken Translations**: Названия услуг в CRM не переводились при смене локали, а статусы («Подтверждена», «Завершена») оставались на русском, даже если выбран английский.
2. **Missing Revenue**: При создании или редактировании записи через CRM админку, стоимость (revenue) не сохранялась в БД.
3. **Inconsistent Data**: Записи для одного и того же клиента могли иметь пустой номер телефона, если они были созданы разными путями (например, через импорт или без явного указания телефона).

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **I18n Fixes**:
    *   **Services**: Обновлена логика в `Bookings.tsx`. Теперь названия услуг ищутся в основном списке услуг и переводятся динамически на основе текущей локали и сохраненных переводов в БД/JSON.
    *   **Statuses**: Исправлен хук `useStatuses.ts` — теперь он реактивно обновляет список статусов при смене языка. Заполнены пустые переводы в `common.json`.
    *   **Formatting**: Формат дат в таблице теперь также зависит от выбранного языка.
2. **Data Consistency**:
    *   **Revenue Fix**: В `backend/db/bookings.py` и `backend/api/bookings.py` добавлена поддержка поля `revenue`. Теперь стоимость корректно сохраняется в БД при создании и редактировании.
    *   **Phone Fallback**: Если в записи бронирования отсутствует номер телефона, бэкенд (`list_bookings`) автоматически подтягивает его из профиля клиента (`clients` table).
    *   **Profile Sync**: При редактировании имени или телефона в записи бронирования, эти изменения автоматически синхронизируются с общим профилем клиента.
3. **Data Cleanup**:
    *   Проведен SQL аудит и исправлены существующие некорректные записи (добавлены недостающие телефоны и суммы на основе имеющихся данных).

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Revenue SSOT**: При добавлении записи из админки, если `revenue` не указан явно, используется текущая цена услуги из справочника.
- **Phone Priority**: В БД хранится `phone` для каждой записи (для истории), но API всегда предоставляет телефон из профиля клиента как fallback.

### ФАЙЛЫ
**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `backend/db/bookings.py` (Save logic)
- `backend/api/bookings.py` (API endpoints full update)
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/Bookings.tsx` (Service localization logic)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useStatuses.ts` (Reactive translation)
- `frontend/scripts/i18n-sync.js` (Automated empty key filling)
- `CHANGELOG.txt`


## 2026-01-02: Управление Функционалом и Валидность Баллов Лояльности

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **Lack of Control**: Отсутствовала возможность включать/выключать модули (Лояльность, Рефералка, Челленджи) без изменения кода.
2. **Infinite Points**: Баллы лояльности не имели срока действия (сгорания), что создавало финансовые обязательства для салона.
3. **Hardcoded Features**: Клиентское приложение не знало, какие фичи включены, и всегда пыталось их отображать.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Feature Management System**:
    - Создан `FeatureService` для управления флагами функций (`loyalty_program`, `referral_program`, `challenges`).
    - Поддержка глобального вкл/выкл, расписания (start/end date) и белых списков (whitelist) для бета-тестирования.
    - Добавлен Admin UI: страница `FeatureManagement` для настройки флагов.
    - Динамический API: `GET /api/public/features` отдает клиенту только доступные ему фичи.
2. **Loyalty Expiration**:
    - В `salon_settings` добавлено поле `points_expiration_days`.
    - `LoyaltyService` при начислении баллов теперь рассчитывает `expires_at`.
    - Добавлена настройка "Срок действия баллов" в `LoyaltyManagement` (Admin).
3. **Client App Integration**:
    - `AccountPage.tsx` теперь запрашивает доступные фичи при загрузке.
    - Вкладки (Loyalty, Achievements/Challenges) скрываются, если фича отключена.
4. **Localization**:
    - Добавлены переводы для новых страниц админки (Feature Management).

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Feature Flags SSOT**: Все проверки фич должны идти через `FeatureService.is_feature_enabled()`. Не проверять JSON из БД напрямую.
- **Whitelist Priority**: Если задан whitelist, фича доступна ТОЛЬКО указанным ID, даже если она глобально включена.
- **Client Cache**: Клиент может кешировать состояние фич. Убедиться, что критичные действия (начисление баллов) проверяют флаг на бэкенде.

### TESTING
- ✅ Проверено глобальное отключение/включение фич через Админку.
- ✅ Проверено скрытие вкладок в Клиентском приложении.
- ✅ Проверено начисление баллов с корректной датой сгорания.
- ✅ Скрипт верификации `check_features.py` отработал успешно.

### ФАЙЛЫ
**НОВЫЕ:**
- `backend/services/features.py` - NEW (Сервис фич)
- `frontend/src/pages/adminPanel/FeatureManagement.tsx` - NEW (UI управления)

**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `backend/services/loyalty.py` - MODIFIED (Логика сгорания)
- `backend/api/client_auth.py` - MODIFIED (API фич)
- `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/AccountPage.tsx` - MODIFIED (Интеграция флагов)
- `frontend/src/pages/adminPanel/LoyaltyManagement.tsx` - MODIFIED (Настройка сгорания)
- `CHANGELOG.txt`

# CHANGELOG - Память проекта Beauty CRM

## 2024-05-24: Финальный аудит и нормализация Личного Кабинета v2

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **API Inconsistency**: Разные эндпоинты использовали разные способы идентификации клиента (id vs instagram_id).
2. **Hardcoded UI**: Компоненты Achievements, Gallery и Settings содержали хардкодные RU-локали для дат и валют.
3. **Partial API Sync**: Настройки уведомлений и приватности не сохранялись в БД.
4. **UX Gaps**: Отсутствовал тип уведомления в API (appointment/promo/achievement) и нормализация аватаров.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Backend Standardization**:
    - Введена вспомогательная функция `_get_client_id(user, c)` для единого поиска `client_id` по всем эндпоинтам.
    - Реализована динамическая логика "Real Dynamics" для Beauty-профиля (сравнение текущего периода с предыдущим).
    - Внедрена автоматическая классификация типов уведомлений на основе содержимого сообщения.
    - Нормализованы URL аватаров для мастеров (всегда абсолютные пути).
    - Реализовано сохранение `notification_prefs` и `privacy_prefs` в виде JSON в таблице `clients`.
2. **Frontend UI/UX Polish**:
    - **Achievements & Gallery**: Форматирование дат переведено на `toLocaleDateString(undefined, ...)` для полной локалезависимости.
    - **Settings**: Полная синхронизация с API. Инициализация состояния из БД, поддержка смены пароля и обновления профиля.
    - **Loyalty**: Переход на динамические уровни (Tier) и валюту (Currency) из конфига салона.
    - **Gallery**: Улучшен UI переключателя "до/после" и добавлена атрибуция мастеров.
3. **Data Integrity**:
    - Исправлен баг в `update_profile` с некорректной привязкой параметров в SQL запросе.
    - Добавлен эндпоинт `mark-all-read` для уведомлений.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **SSOT Preferences**: Настройки приложения хранятся в `clients.preferences` как JSON. При добавлении новых настроек обновлять и фронт, и логику парсинга в `get_client_profile`.
- **Absolute URLs**: Бэкенд всегда должен возвращать полные URL для статических файлов, чтобы избежать битых картинок на фронте.
- **Client Identification**: Всегда использовать `_get_client_id` для работы с данными клиента в `client_auth.py`.

### TESTING
- ✅ Проверена синхронизация настроек (Push/Email/SMS/Privacy).
- ✅ Проверена динамика beauty-метрик при наличии визитов.
- ✅ Проверена локализация дат на разных языках браузера.
- ✅ Исправлены все lint-ошибки в Masters.tsx и Settings.tsx.

### ФАЙЛЫ
**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `backend/api/client_auth.py` (Major Logic Update)
- `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/v2_components/Settings.tsx`
- `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/v2_components/Achievements.tsx`
- `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/v2_components/Masters.tsx`

- `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/v2_components/Appointments.tsx`
- `CHANGELOG.txt`

## 2025-12-28: Откат Редизайна Визарда с сохранением Улучшенного Футера

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **User Feedback**: Пользователь попросил откатить полный редизайн визарда бронирования к оригинальному состоянию (Simplicity First).
2. **Feature Retention**: Единственным элементом, который понравился пользователю, был новый футер ("Presence Bar") при выборе мастера с отображением фото и имени.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Design Rollback**:
    - Файлы `UserBookingWizard.tsx` и `UserBookingWizard.css` откачены к состоянию до начала сессии редизайна (через `git restore`).
    - Возвращены оригинальные карточки услуг, простая сетка мастеров и стандартный календарь.
2. **Selective Merge (Footer)**:
    - В компонент `ProfessionalStep` интегрирован новый премиальный футер (`booking-footer-bar` с классом `container-blur`).
    - Реализовано динамическое отображение фото и имени выбранного мастера (или "Flexible Master" при выборе любого специалиста).
    - Добавлены соответствующие CSS стили в `UserBookingWizard.css` для корректной работы размытия, теней и фиксированной позиции футера.
3. **UX Optimization**:
    - Сохранена логика анимации появления футера через `framer-motion`.
    - Для остальных шагов (Services, DateTime) возвращена оригинальная логика футеров, но они унаследовали современный стиль контейнера.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Hybrid Approach**: Текущий визард — это микс оригинальной простоты и одного премиального элемента управления.
- **SSOT Components**: Логика выбора данных осталась нетронутой.

### TESTING
- ✅ Проверен откат дизайна всех шагов.
- ✅ Проверено отображение аватара мастера в футере `ProfessionalStep`.
- ✅ Проверена адаптивность и кликабельность кнопок навигации в новом футере.

### ФАЙЛЫ
**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/UserBookingWizard.tsx`
- `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/UserBookingWizard.css`
- `CHANGELOG.txt`



## 2025-12-26: Локализация и Динамические Данные Личного Кабинета

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **Hardcoded Strings**: В `AccountPage.tsx` почти все строки (заголовки, кнопки, статусы) были на русском языке.
2. **Static Data**: Секции челленджей, достижений и инсайтов использовали статические данные вместо реальных из БД.
3. **Date Formatting**: Даты форматировались без учета локали пользователя.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Full Localization**:
    - Все хардкодные строки в `AccountPage.tsx` заменены на вызовы `t()` с использованием пространства имен `account`.
    - Локализованы все вкладки: Дашборд, Галерея, Достижения, Beauty-профиль, Мастера, Уведомления, Настройки.
    - Обновлены файлы локалей `frontend/src/locales/ru/account.json` и `frontend/src/locales/en/account.json`.
2. **Dynamic Data Integration**:
    - Подключены реальные данные из `dashboardData` (API `get_client_dashboard`).
    - Секция челленджей теперь отображает актуальные задачи из БД.
    - Реализована логика выбора языка для заголовков и описаний достижений/челленджей (`title_ru` vs `title_en`).
    - Исправлен расчет Beauty Score и отображение графиков здоровья.
3. **Date & Time**:
    - Все даты теперь форматируются через `date-fns` с использованием динамической локали `getDateLocale()`.
4. **Cleanup**:
    - Удален неиспользуемый обработчик `handleFavoritePhoto` и связанный с ним `selectedPhotoId`.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **i18n SSOT**: При добавлении новых секций в ЛК обязательно добавлять ключи в `account.json` для обоих языков.
- **Dynamic Titles**: Достижения и челленджи в БД имеют поля `_ru` и `_en`. Код в `AccountPage.tsx` автоматически выбирает нужный ключ на основе `i18n.language`.
- **Date Fns Locale**: Всегда передавать объект `locale` в функцию `format()` для корректного отображения названий месяцев.

### TESTING
- ✅ Проверено переключение языков (RU/EN).
- ✅ Проверено отображение реальных челленждей из БД.
- ✅ Проверено форматирование дат в уведомлениях и достижениях.
- ✅ Проверена работа всех вкладок после рефакторинга.

### ФАЙЛЫ
**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/AccountPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/locales/ru/account.json`
- `frontend/src/locales/en/account.json`
- `backend/api/client_auth.py` (обновлена структура dashboard)
- `CHANGELOG.txt`


## 2025-12-26: Рефакторинг Галереи и Расширение Данных Клиента

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **Gallery Fragmentation**: Галерея работ клиента находилась в `Services.tsx`, что логически неверно. Она должна быть частью профиля клиента.
2. **Missing Client Fields**: Отсутствовали поля для логина (email), хешированного пароля, персональной скидки и промокода в админке.
3. **Hardcoded Strings**: В `ClientDetail.tsx` и `Services.tsx` оставались нелокализованные строки.
4. **Lint Warnings**: В `AccountPage.tsx` и `UserBookingWizard.tsx` висели неиспользуемые переменные.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Admin Refactoring**:
    - `Services.tsx`: Удалена вкладка "Галерея" и вся связанная логика. Локализована вкладка "Челленджи".
    - `ClientDetail.tsx`: Добавлена секция "Галерея работ" внизу страницы с возможностью загрузки/удаления фото.
    - Добавлены поля Email/Login, Password, Спец. скидка и Промокод в форму редактирования клиента.
2. **Backend Updates**:
    - `backend/db/clients.py`: Функция `update_client_info` теперь поддерживает новые поля.
    - `backend/api/clients.py`: API хеширует пароль перед сохранением (SHA256).
    - `backend/utils/utils.py`: Добавлена утилита `hash_password`.
3. **Localization**:
    - Добавлены ключи в `ru/admin/ClientDetail.json` и `en/admin/ClientDetail.json`.
4. **Cleanup**:
    - Удалены неиспользуемые `StatCard`, `TrendingUp`, `useSearchParams` и другие переменные в `AccountPage.tsx` и `UserBookingWizard.tsx`.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Password Hashing**: Пароли клиентов теперь хранятся в виде SHA256 хешей. Не сохранять в открытом виде!
- **Gallery Context**: Галерея работ теперь привязана к `client_id` и управляется из карточки клиента.
- **SSOT**: Все изменения данных клиента проходят через `update_client_info`.

### TESTING
- ✅ Проверена загрузка фото в галерею через админку.
- ✅ Проверено сохранение новых полей клиента.
- ✅ Проверена локализация Admin Panel (RU/EN).

### ФАЙЛЫ
**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/Services.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/ClientDetail.tsx`
- `backend/db/clients.py`
- `backend/api/clients.py`
- `backend/utils/utils.py`
- `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/AccountPage.tsx`
- `frontend/public_landing/pages/account/UserBookingWizard.tsx`

## 2025-12-25: Исправление PostgreSQL синтаксиса и рефакторинг тестов

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. **PostgreSQL Syntax Error**: В файле `master_schedule.py` использовались функции `TO_CHAR` и `DATE` к колонкам типа `TEXT` (колонки `datetime` в таблицах `bookings` и `booking_drafts`), что приводило к ошибке: `function to_char(text, unknown) does not exist`.
2. **Schema Mismatch**: Таблица `booking_drafts` не имела колонок `datetime`, `master` и `expires_at`, которые запрашивались в `master_schedule.py`.
3. **Verbose Tests**: Скрипт `run_all_tests.py` выводил слишком много лишней информации при успешном прохождении тестов, что затрудняло поиск ошибок.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **SQL Fixes**:
   - В `backend/services/master_schedule.py` добавлено явное приведение типов: `datetime::timestamp`.
   - Исправлен SQL-запрос в `get_available_slots`: JOIN таблицы `services` теперь корректно использует `service_name` вместо отсутствующей колонки `service_id`.
   - Исправлена ошибка `NameError: end_dt` и конфликты типов datetime (naive/aware).
   - В метод `get_available_slots` добавлен флаг `return_metadata=False` для обеспечения обратной совместимости (возврат списка строк по умолчанию).
   - Исправлены запросы к таблицам `bookings` и `booking_drafts`.

2. **Database Schema Update**:
   - Обновлена миграция `backend/db/migrations/consolidated/schema_bookings.py`: в таблицу `booking_drafts` добавлены колонки `datetime`, `master` и `expires_at`.
   - Обновлен метод `update_booking_progress` в `backend/db/bookings.py` для автоматического извлечения данных из JSON и заполнения новых колонок.
   - Установлено время истечения черновика (expires_at) — 30 минут.

3. **Test Orchestrator Refactoring**:
   - `backend/tests/run_all_tests.py` полностью переписан.
   - Введена вспомогательная функция `run_suite` для запуска тестов.
   - Реализовано подавление вывода (stdout/stderr) для успешных тестов. Вывод показывается только в случае провала (FAIL).
   - Добавлен финальный детальный отчет со статистикой.
   - Добавлен автоматический запуск проверки услуг без мастеров.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Explicit Casting**: В PostgreSQL при использовании функций даты/времени к текстовым полям ВСЕГДА использовать `::timestamp`.
- **SSOT Schema**: Все изменения схем должны отражаться в `consolidated` миграциях.
- **Test Output Control**: Для поддержания чистоты логов в CI/CD и при разработке, успешные тесты не должны засорять консоль.

### TESTING
- ✅ Запущен полный цикл тестов (10/10 пройдены).
- ✅ Проверена работа `master_schedule.py` с PostgreSQL.
- ✅ Проверена автоматическая очистка данных после тестов.

### ФАЙЛЫ
**ИЗМЕНЕНЫ:**
- `backend/services/master_schedule.py` — исправлен SQL синтаксис.
- `backend/db/migrations/consolidated/schema_bookings.py` — обновлена схема `booking_drafts`.
- `backend/db/bookings.py` — обновлена логика сохранения черновиков.
- `backend/tests/run_all_tests.py` — полная переработка оркестратора тестов.

## 2025-12-25: Система регистрации с email верификацией и админским одобрением

### ПРОБЛЕМА
Старая система регистрации имела критические недостатки:
- Любой мог зарегистрироваться и сразу получить доступ (auto_verify = True)
- Не было подтверждения email адреса
- Не было контроля админов над новыми регистрациями
- Проверка дубликатов username/email была case-sensitive
- Demo Client создавался вручную или через старые скрипты
- Email verification был реализован но ОТКЛЮЧЕН (закомментирован в core/auth.py)

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. Создан полноценный email сервис:
   - `backend/utils/email_service.py` - универсальный модуль отправки писем
   - `send_verification_code_email()` - отправка 6-значного кода (вместо ссылки)
   - `send_admin_notification_email()` - уведомление админов о новой регистрации
   - `send_registration_approved_email()` - уведомление пользователя об одобрении
   - `send_registration_rejected_email()` - уведомление об отклонении
   - Красивые HTML шаблоны с градиентными заголовками

2. Созданы миграции БД:
   - `db/migrations/schema/create_email_verification_tables.py`
   - Таблица `client_email_verifications` для кодов верификации клиентов
   - Таблица `registration_audit` для аудита всех действий с регистрациями

3. Модуль управления регистрациями:
   - `backend/db/pending_registrations.py`
   - `get_pending_registrations()` - список ожидающих одобрения
   - `approve_registration()` - одобрение с отправкой email
   - `reject_registration()` - отклонение с указанием причины
   - `delete_pending_registration()` - полное удаление
   - `get_registration_audit_log()` - история всех действий

4. Admin API для управления:
   - `backend/api/admin_registrations.py`
   - GET `/api/admin/registrations/pending` - список pending users
  - POST `/api/admin/registrations/approve` - одобрить
   - POST `/api/admin/registrations/reject` - отклонить
   - DELETE `/api/admin/registrations/{user_id}` - удалить
   - GET `/api/admin/registrations/audit-log` - лог действий
   - Все endpoints требуют роль director или admin

5. Обновлена core логика аутентификации:
   - `backend/core/auth.py` - ОСНОВНЫЕ ИЗМЕНЕНИЯ:
     * ВКЛЮЧЕНЫ проверки email_verified и is_active при логине (строки 46-95)
     * Исключение для admin пользователя (admin/admin123 всегда может войти)
     * AUTO-ACTIVATION только для первого admin (строки 221-236)
     * Case-insensitive проверка username и email (строки 186-201)
     * Отправка кода верификации вместо ссылки (строка 315)
     * Уведомление всех директоров о новой регистрации (строки 318-335)
     * Подробные error_type в ответах: "email_not_verified", "not_approved"
   
6. Зарегистрирован новый роутер:
   - `backend/main.py` (строки 106, 179)
   - Импорт и регистрация admin_registrations_router

7. Создан test suite:
   - `backend/scripts/testing/test_registration.py`
   - 6 комплексных тестов всего flow

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Email верификация ВКЛЮЧЕНА** - все новые пользователи должны подтвердить email
- **Admin approval ТРЕБУЕТСЯ** - даже после email verification нужно одобрение админа
- **Исключение для admin** - пользователь с username "admin" автоактивируется
- **Demo Client НЕ НАЙДЕН** - либо создавался вручную, либо уже удален
- **SMTP НУЖЕН** - без настройки SMTP письма не отправляются
- **Case-insensitive checks** - "User" и "user" считаются одинаковыми

### FLOW РЕГИСТРАЦИИ
1. Пользователь заполняет форму регистрации
2. Backend проверяет уникальность username и email (case-insensitive)
3. Создается user с is_active=FALSE, email_verified=FALSE
4. Генерируется 6-значный код (срок действия 15 минут)
5. Код отправляется на email пользователя
6. Уведомления отправляются всем директорам
7. Пользователь вводит код → email_verified=TRUE
8. Админ одобряет → is_active=TRUE → отправляется email
9. Пользователь может войти в систему

### УНИВЕРСАЛЬНОСТЬ КОДА ✅
**НЕТ ХАРДКОДА:**
- ✅ SMTP настройки из ENV переменных (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWORD)
- ✅ URL приложения из ENV (APP_URL, ADMIN_PANEL_URL)
- ✅ Email templates с параметризацией
- ✅ Verificaction code length настраивается (по умолчанию 6)
- ✅ Code expiry настраивается (по умолчанию 15 минут)
- ✅ Роли админов динамические ('director', 'admin')

**Примеры универсальности:**
```python
# Backend поддерживает все языки
parse_duration_to_minutes("1h 30min")    # → 90 (английский)
parse_duration_to_minutes("1ч 30мин")    # → 90 (русский)
parse_duration_to_minutes("2 Std 15 Min") # → 135 (немецкий)

format_duration_display(90, 'ru')  # → "1ч 30мин"
format_duration_display(90, 'de')  # → "1Std 30Min"
format_duration_display(90, 'hi')  # → "1घंटा 30मिनट"
```

### МОЖЕТ СЛОМАТЬСЯ
- **SMTP не настроен** → письма не отправятся (fallback: показать код в console/response)
- **Существующие users** → могут иметь is_active=TRUE без email_verified
- **Admin user отсутствует** → некому будет одобрять первые регистрации
- **Frontend не обновлен** → пользователи не смогут ввести код верификации
- **Миграции не запущены** →
### [2024-05-22] Full High-Fidelity Design Refresh (Round 2)

## 2025-12-13: Миграция формата длительности услуг

### ПРОБЛЕМА
Длительность услуг хранилась в текстовом формате ("1h", "1h 30min", "1ч 30"), что вызывало проблемы:
- Бот не мог понять формат "1ч 30"
- Сложный парсинг в разных местах кода (дублирование логики)
- Нет поддержки многоязычного отображения

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. Создан модуль `utils/duration_utils.py` с универсальными функциями:
   - `parse_duration_to_minutes(duration_str)` - парсит любой формат в минуты
   - `format_duration_display(minutes, language)` - форматирует минуты в читаемый вид
   
2. Изменен формат хранения в БД:
   - БЫЛО: `duration TEXT` с значениями "1h", "1h 30min", "1ч 30" 
   - СТАЛО: `duration TEXT` с значениями в минутах: "60", "90"
   
3. Обновлен код во всех местах использования:
   - `bot/tools.py` - использует `parse_duration_to_minutes()`
   - `bot/prompts.py` - использует `format_duration_display(minutes, language)`
   - `db/employees.py` - использует утилиты для расчета занятых слотов

4. Создан скрипт миграции:
   - `scripts/migrations/migrate_duration_to_minutes.py` - одноразовый скрипт
   - Функция добавлена в `scripts/maintenance/fix_data.py` (SSOT принцип)

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **НЕ хранить длительность в текстовом формате** - только минуты (числа)
- **Использовать утилиты**: `parse_duration_to_minutes()` и `format_duration_display()`
- **Для отображения всегда указывать язык**: format_duration_display(90, 'ru') → "1ч 30мин"
- **Миграция уже выполнена** - все услуги переведены в новый формат

### УНИВЕРСАЛЬНОСТЬ КОДА ✅
**НЕТ ХАРДКОДА:**
- ✅ Список языков вынесен в константу `DURATION_FORMATS`
- ✅ Поддержка всех 9 языков проекта: ru, en, ar, de, es, fr, hi, kk, pt
- ✅ Парсинг работает с любыми форматами: "1h", "1ч", "1 Std", "1 hour", "90"
- ✅ Автоматический fallback на русский язык если язык не найден
- ✅ Синхронизация с `frontend/public/locales/`
- ✅ Функция `get_supported_languages()` для динамического получения списка языков

**Примеры универсальности:**
```python
# Backend поддерживает все языки
parse_duration_to_minutes("1h 30min")    # → 90 (английский)
parse_duration_to_minutes("1ч 30мин")    # → 90 (русский)
parse_duration_to_minutes("2 Std 15 Min") # → 135 (немецкий)

format_duration_display(90, 'ru')  # → "1ч 30мин"
format_duration_display(90, 'de')  # → "1Std 30Min"
format_duration_display(90, 'hi')  # → "1घंटा 30मिनट"
```

### МОЖЕТ СЛОМАТЬСЯ
- Если где-то в коде ожидается текстовый формат "1h 30min" вместо "90"
- Если при создании новой услуги duration записывается в старом формате
- Проверить API endpoints создания/обновления услуг

### TESTING
Проверено преобразование:
- "1h" → 60 → "1ч" (ru), "1h" (en), "1س" (ar) ✅
- "1h 30min" → 90 → "1ч 30мин" (ru), "1h 30min" (en) ✅  
- "90" → 90 → "1ч 30мин" ✅
- "2h" → 120 → "2ч" ✅

### ФАЙЛЫ
- `backend/utils/duration_utils.py` - NEW
- `backend/bot/tools.py` - MODIFIED (упрощен парсинг)
- `backend/bot/prompts.py` - MODIFIED (форматирование с учетом языка)

## 2026-03-24: Расширение источников записи и улучшение панели чата

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. В системе не хватало источников записи (личный кабинет, гостевая ссылка, Telegram, WhatsApp).
2. В панели информации чата (InfoPanel) отсутствовали тексты из-за пустых строк в файлах локализации.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Источники записи**:
   - В `Bookings.tsx` добавлена возможность выбора источника при создании/редактировании записи.
   - Поддерживаемые источники: Вручную, ЛК, Гостевая ссылка, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp.
   - В таблицу записей добавлены иконки и сокращения для новых источников (👤 ЛК, 🔗 Ссылка).

2. **Улучшение InfoPanel (Чат)**:
   - Добавлено отображение источника клиента.
   - Добавлены блоки с прямыми ссылками на Telegram и WhatsApp (если указаны ID или телефон).
   - Все вызовы `t()` в `InfoPanel.tsx` дополнены дефолтными значениями (fallback) на русском языке. Это гарантирует отображение текста даже при пустых JSON-файлах переводов.

3. **Backend**:
   - API и функции БД клиентов расширены для передачи полей `source` и `telegram_id`.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Дефолтные значения в t()**: Для критически важных элементов интерфейса всегда указывать второй аргумент в `t('key', 'Default Text')`.
- **Авто-перевод**: После добавления новых ключей в код рекомендуется запускать `npm run db:i18n:auto`.

## 2026-01-10: Исправление данных сотрудников и надежности скриптов обслуживания

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. В тестах `test_employee_management.py` ожидались полные имена сотрудников (`Mohamed Sabri`, `Amandurdyyeva Mestan` и др.), в то время как в базе использовались технические логины (`simo`, `mestan`).
2. Скрипты обслуживания (`fix_data.py`, `sync_master_services.py`) использовали хардкод ID, что приводило к ошибкам при пересоздании базы данных.
3. Биографии мастеров затирались шаблонами при каждом запуске `fix_data.py`.
4. Скрипты синхронизации переводов имели ошибки в путях к локалям фронтенда.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **SSOT данные сотрудников**: В `db/init.py` обновлены `employees_data` — теперь полные имена установлены как стандарт.
2. **Удаление хардкода ID**: 
   - Скрипты `fix_data.py` и `sync_master_services.py` переведены на поиск по `username`.
   - `fix_master_data.py` теперь поддерживает поиск как по полному имени, так и по логину (case-insensitive).
3. **Защита данных пользователя**: В `fix_data.py` обновление биографий теперь использует `COALESCE(NULLIF(bio, ''), %s)`, чтобы не перезаписывать уже существующие (измененные вручную) описания.
4. **Исправление инфраструктуры**:
   - Исправлены пути в `sync_translations.py` и `populate_all_languages.py`.
   - Проведена очистка дубликатов импортов и неиспользуемых переменных.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Никогда не использовать хардкод ID** в скриптах обслуживания. Только `username` или `service_key`.
- **Принцип SSOT**: Все изменения структуры или базовых данных должны быть в `db/init.py` или консолидированных миграциях.

## 2026-01-30: Замена Unicode эмодзи на иконки Lucide и исправление ошибок API

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. Использование Unicode эмодзи (💡, ✓, ⚡ и др.) в интерфейсе нарушало визуальную консистентность и противоречило правилам проекта.
2. В странице настроек сотрудника (Settings.tsx) был обнаружен критический баг в функции смены пароля: вызов `api.changePassword` не соответствовал сигнатуре бэкенда (ожидался userId и объект с данными).
3. Накопились неиспользуемые импорты и переменные в ряде фронтенд-файлов.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **Визуальное обновление**:
   - Во всех ключевых разделах (Analytics, Clients, Settings, Bookings, Users, Profile) Unicode эмодзи заменены на соответствующие иконки `lucide-react` (Lightbulb, Check, Zap, X и др.).
   - Для списков (например, в Clients Export) теперь используются flex-контейнеры с иконками для улучшения читаемости.
2. **Исправление багов**:
   - В `frontend/src/pages/employee/Settings.tsx` исправлен вызов `api.changePassword`. Теперь передается ID текущего профиля и объект `{ old_password, new_password }`.
3. **Оптимизация кода**:
   - Проведена очистка неиспользуемых импортов (AlertCircle, Upload, i18n и др.) в файлах `Clients.tsx`, `EmployeeProfile.tsx` и `Settings.tsx` согласно Rule #10.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- **Консистентность иконок**: Всегда использовать `lucide-react` вместо Unicode эмодзи в UI элементах (кнопки, плашки, подсказки).
- **Сигнатура API**: Перед использованием методов `ApiClient` (особенно `changePassword`) всегда проверять их определение в `api.ts`.

- **Универсальность бэкенда**: Модифицирована функция t() в backend/utils/translation.py для поддержки плейсхолдеров {{variable}} через kwargs.
- **Исправление фронтенда**:
  - AuditLog.tsx: Исправлено отображение статистики (добавлен проброс count: 24).
  - InternalChat.tsx: Исправлено уведомление о размере файла (динамический max).
  - PlansManagement.tsx: Исправлен выбор периода "2 недели", удалено дублирование поля name в интерфейсе Metric.
- **Локализация (RU)**:
  - Исправлен перевод characters_count (плейсхолдеры вместо "персонажи").
  - Исправлен ключ manage_goals_and_targets.

## 2026-02-12: Стабилизация поведения сайдбара и доработка страницы услуг

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. После обновления страницы группы в левом меню могли сворачиваться, даже если текущий маршрут находился внутри подгруппы.
2. Сайдбар не прокручивался автоматически к активному пункту при глубокой навигации.
3. На странице услуг заголовок столбца `status` был принудительно зафиксирован на английском.
4. Во вкладках `/crm/services` дублировались переходы в разделы рефералов и челленджей, хотя они уже есть в группе инструментов меню.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. В `UniversalLayout.tsx` добавлено автоматическое определение активной группы по текущему `location.pathname`.
2. Добавлено авто-раскрытие активной группы и сохранение раскрытого состояния для текущего маршрута после refresh.
3. Добавлена автоматическая прокрутка desktop-сайдбара к активному пункту (`scrollIntoView`) после рендера.
4. В `Services.tsx` удалены вкладки "Реферальная программа" и "Челленджи" из верхней панели.
5. Заголовок столбца статуса переведен обратно на `t('common:status')` без принудительного английского `toLowerCase`.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Для заголовков и label в UI не фиксировать язык вручную через `lng: 'en'`, если нужен стандартный перевод из текущей локали.
- Навигационные группы, содержащие текущий маршрут, должны оставаться раскрытыми после перезагрузки страницы.

## 2026-02-12: Доработка настроек и стабильности навигации

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. В `settings/general` заголовок блока рабочего графика отображался как сырой ключ `working_schedule`.
2. В форме общих настроек подписи полей находились слишком близко к инпутам.
3. Плейсхолдеры в части полей выглядели темнее ожидаемого и выбивались по тону.
4. В левом меню авто-скролл срабатывал при ручном раскрытии групп и мешал открыть другую группу.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. Добавлен ключ `working_schedule` в словари `admin/settings` для всех поддерживаемых языков.
2. В `Settings.tsx` увеличены вертикальные интервалы между label и input в секции `general`.
3. В `Settings.css` и `crm-pages.css` унифицирован цвет плейсхолдеров до нейтрального серого.
4. В `UniversalLayout.tsx` авто-скролл/авто-раскрытие привязаны к смене маршрута, а не к каждому клику по группе.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Авто-прокрутка меню должна реагировать только на переход между страницами, чтобы не ломать ручное управление раскрытием групп.
- Для новых UI-заголовков в `settings` ключи должны добавляться во все локали, чтобы не появлялись сырые ключи в интерфейсе.

## 2026-02-12: Исправление RBAC и устранение дублей в special-packages

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. В системе ролей/прав были несогласованные ключи и проверки (`saler` vs `sales`, невалидные permission-ключи в API, несовпадение endpoint для списка прав).
2. В назначении ролей и управлении custom permissions были риски некорректной валидации и падений при edge-case сценариях.
3. На `/crm/special-packages` во вкладке рефералов визуально дублировались блоки кампаний, а таблица истории была недостаточно адаптивной.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. **RBAC backend стабилизирован**:
   - Добавлена нормализация legacy-ролей (`saler` -> `sales`) в `core/config.py` и `utils/permissions.py`.
   - Исправлены проверки доступа в `api/permissions.py` (`roles_edit`/`roles_view`), добавлен корректный resolver ключей прав.
   - Исправлена валидация назначения роли в `api/users.py` с учетом custom roles и иерархии.
   - Источником списка доступных прав сделан `PERMISSION_DESCRIPTIONS` (SSOT) в `api/roles.py`.
2. **RBAC frontend синхронизирован**:
   - Роутинг и role-matching унифицированы на `sales` с обратной совместимостью для legacy `/saler/*`.
   - Исправлены отображения роли продаж в UI через существующий ключ `role_saler`.
   - Обновлен клиентский endpoint списка прав на `/api/roles/permissions/available`.
3. **Special Packages (referrals) доработан**:
   - Убрано дублирование пустых/списковых блоков кампаний во вкладке рефералов.
   - Улучшена адаптивность фильтров и таблицы истории (горизонтальный скролл, скрытие служебной колонки на mobile).

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Для ролей использовать канонический ключ `sales`; `saler` поддерживать только как legacy alias.
- Любые permission-декораторы должны ссылаться только на ключи из `PERMISSION_DESCRIPTIONS`.
- Для списка прав в UI использовать единый endpoint `/api/roles/permissions/available`.
- В special-packages пустое состояние кампаний и список кампаний должны рендериться в одном контейнере, чтобы не возникало визуального дубля.

## 2026-02-12: Проверка и усиление маркетинговых сценариев (promo/packages/challenges)

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. В special-packages оставались сценарии, где числовые поля могли дать `NaN` и привести к ошибкам сохранения.
2. В API промокодов отсутствовала строгая серверная валидация (диапазоны скидки, даты, лимиты).
3. В клиентском endpoint `/api/client/achievements` прогресс челленджей читался из legacy-полей (`progress`, `user_id`) и ломался при текущей схеме (`current_value`, `client_id`).
4. Для спецпакетов требовалась дополнительная защита на backend от некорректных цен/дат при create/update.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. В `SpecialPackages.tsx` добавлен безопасный парсинг числовых полей и дополнительные проверки перед сохранением пакетов, настроек рефералки и кампаний.
2. В `api/promo_codes.py` добавлена валидация payload при создании промокода:
   - code обязателен;
   - `discount_type` только `percent|fixed`;
   - `value > 0`, для `%` не более 100;
   - `min_amount >= 0`, `max_uses >= 1` (если задан);
   - `valid_until >= valid_from`.
3. В `db/promo_codes.py` проверка промокода дополнена `valid_from` (промокод еще не активен) и нормализацией пустого кода.
4. В `client_auth.py` чтение челленджей и прогресса сделано schema-aware (определение колонок через `information_schema`) с поддержкой обеих схем.
5. В `api/services.py` сохранена и расширена серверная валидация спецпакетов (цены/даты) для create/update.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Критические бизнес-валидации (цены, скидки, даты, лимиты) должны дублироваться на backend даже при наличии frontend-проверок.
- Для таблиц с legacy-историей (`active_challenges`, `challenge_progress`) API должен адаптироваться к реальной схеме, а не полагаться на фиксированные имена колонок.

## 2026-02-12: Возврат вкладки "Услуги" на странице special-packages

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. При переходе из `/services` на `/special-packages` пропадал быстрый путь обратно в раздел услуг.
2. Пользователь видел только вкладки маркетингового блока (`спецпакеты`, `рефералы`, `челленджи`, `лояльность`, `промокоды`) без явной вкладки `Услуги`.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. В `SpecialPackages.tsx` добавлен роут-ориентированный переход на `.../services` для всех рабочих префиксов (`/crm`, `/manager`, `/sales`, `/marketer`, `/admin`).
2. В верхнюю навигацию раздела special-packages добавлена вкладка `Услуги` (иконка `Scissors`) с переходом обратно в список услуг.
3. Для надписи вкладки использован существующий i18n-ключ `admin/services:services` без добавления дубликатов переводов.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Для экранов, которые объединяют несколько бизнес-разделов, обязательно оставлять явный путь возврата к родительскому разделу.
- Для имен вкладок использовать существующие переводные ключи из `admin/services`, чтобы не плодить дубликаты в словарях.

## 2026-02-12: Рефакторинг адаптивности и UX страницы LoyaltyManagement

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. Во вкладке `Лояльность` в embedded-режиме (внутри special-packages) были неадаптивные блоки:
   - фиксированные ширины;
   - заголовки и кнопки ломались на узких экранах;
   - таблицы не имели горизонтального скролла.
2. В интерфейсе использовались числовые поля с `parseInt/parseFloat` без защит, что могло давать `NaN` при пустом вводе.
3. Текст подсказки по кэшбэку выводился с шаблонными плейсхолдерами (`{{percent}}`, `{{points}}`) без интерполяции значений.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. Обновлена верстка `LoyaltyManagement`:
   - адаптивный header и CTA;
   - адаптивные карточки блоков;
   - responsive-компоновка настроек;
   - таблицы категорий и транзакций обернуты в `overflow-x-auto`.
2. Добавлены безопасные парсеры чисел (`parseNumberOrFallback`, `parseIntegerOrFallback`) и применены во всех критичных `onChange`.
3. Исправлена интерполяция подсказки `config.cashback_hint` и сообщений по корректировке баллов.
4. Добавлена фильтрация таблицы транзакций по поиску (клиент/email/причина).

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Для форм админки не использовать прямой `parseInt/parseFloat` без fallback, чтобы не протекал `NaN` в state и API payload.
- Для таблиц в CRM-блоках всегда предусматривать горизонтальный скролл на мобильных.

## 2026-02-12: Унификация вкладок Services <-> SpecialPackages

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. Переход из `/crm/services` в `special-packages` воспринимался как смена на другой паттерн табов:
   - отличался визуальный стиль вкладок;
   - в `referrals` оставалась отдельная стрелка назад, что выглядело неединообразно.
2. Порядок блоков в `special-packages` для `packages/referrals` отличался от `loyalty/challenges`.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. В `SpecialPackages.tsx` удалена стрелка назад для `referrals` и оставлен единый таб-переход через вкладку `Услуги`.
2. В `SpecialPackages.tsx` порядок секции приведен к единому виду:
   - сначала таб-навигация;
   - затем заголовок и контент (`packages/referrals`).
3. В `crm-pages.css` обновлен стиль табов страницы `Services`:
   - кнопочный outline-вид;
   - синий активный таб;
   - убрана “карточка-контейнер” вокруг табов.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Для связанных разделов (`services`, `special-packages`, `referrals`, `challenges`, `loyalty`, `promo-codes`) использовать один визуальный паттерн вкладок и навигации.
- Не добавлять параллельные механики возврата, если уже есть явная вкладка перехода (`Услуги`).

## 2026-02-12: Выравнивание embedded-вкладок Loyalty/Challenges и уточнение названий рефералов

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. Во вкладке `special-packages?section=loyalty` блок глобальных настроек выглядел сжато: подписи и инпуты были прижаты, кнопка сохранения стояла не в логичном месте.
2. Во вкладке `special-packages?section=challenges` embedded-стиль визуально отличался от более чистого паттерна `referrals` (слишком агрессивная типографика и пустое состояние).
3. Названия внутри реферального блока были неочевидны для пользователя (`Все рефералы` vs `Реферальные кампании`).

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. В `LoyaltyManagement.tsx` переработана embedded-верстка глобальных настроек:
   - увеличены отступы и межстрочные интервалы;
   - поля и подписи выстроены в читаемые группы;
   - кнопка `Сохранить` вынесена в более предсказуемую позицию и адаптирована под мобильные экраны.
2. В `Challenges.tsx` для embedded-режима упрощены карточки и пустое состояние:
   - сняты лишние стили, приведены размеры/тексты к спокойному виду;
   - улучшена читаемость метрик;
   - сохранен единый визуальный язык с карточками `referrals`.
3. Уточнены названия реферальных вкладок и заголовков:
   - `История приглашений`
   - `Кампании и бонусы`
4. Обновлены i18n-значения `table.title` в `adminPanel/ReferralProgram` для RU/EN, чтобы старое имя `Все рефералы` больше не появлялось в связанных экранах.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Для embedded-страниц внутри `special-packages` использовать единый ритм отступов и типографики, близкий к `referrals`, без перегруженных эффектов.
- Внутренние названия вкладок должны отличаться по смыслу (`история` vs `кампании`), чтобы пользователь сразу понимал разницу.

## 2026-02-12: Унификация стиля вкладок Services и цветовой схемы Challenges в special-packages

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. Вкладки в `/crm/services` визуально отличались от вкладок в `/crm/special-packages` (высота, отступы, общий стиль кнопок).
2. Во встроенной вкладке `special-packages?section=challenges` цвет фона и акцентных блоков статистики отличался от `special-packages?section=loyalty`.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. В `Services.tsx` верхние табы (`Услуги`, `Спецпакеты`) переведены на тот же UI-паттерн, что и в `SpecialPackages.tsx`:
   - `Button` с `variant="default"` для активной вкладки;
   - `Button` с `variant="outline"` для неактивной;
   - те же классы (`bg-blue-600`, `border-gray-300`, `hover:bg-gray-100`), чтобы совпали высота и визуальный ритм.
2. В `Challenges.tsx` для embedded-режима (когда страница открыта внутри `special-packages`) палитра статистических карточек приведена к стилю `loyalty`:
   - синие/зеленые фоновые акценты `bg-blue-100` / `bg-green-100`;
   - соответствующие цвета иконок `text-blue-600` / `text-green-600`.
3. Для standalone-страницы `challenges` (вне `special-packages`) исходная палитра сохранена, чтобы не ломать отдельный сценарий.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Для связки страниц `services` и `special-packages` таб-навигация должна использовать один и тот же компонентный паттерн и размеры.
- Для embedded-вкладок внутри special-packages цветовые акценты статистики держать единообразными между `loyalty`, `challenges`, `promo-codes`, `referrals`.

## 2026-02-12: Статусы уровней/правил бонусной программы и стабилизация вкладок Services/Special-Packages

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. В `special-packages?section=loyalty` было нельзя явно включать/отключать уровни привилегий и правила по категориям из списка.
2. В диалогах редактирования уровня/правила заголовок и контент выглядели прижатыми.
3. Термин `Множители категорий` был неочевиден по смыслу для администраторов.
4. Верхние вкладки и высота контейнеров в `/crm/services` и `/crm/special-packages` оставались не полностью синхронизированы, из-за чего при переходах интерфейс визуально "прыгал".

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. В `LoyaltyManagement.tsx` добавлены явные статусы и действия:
   - кнопки `Включить/Отключить` для правил категорий;
   - кнопки `Включить/Отключить` для уровней привилегий;
   - статус в форме редактирования уровня и в форме правила.
2. В `LoyaltyManagement.tsx` переработаны отступы диалогов и заголовков карточек:
   - увеличены интервалы в `DialogHeader` и формах;
   - выровнена компоновка глобальных настроек, включая кнопку `Сохранить`.
3. Переименованы и уточнены тексты блока категорий:
   - `Правила начисления по категориям`;
   - `Коэффициент начисления`;
   - добавлено пояснение о базовой ставке `x1` при выключенном правиле.
4. В `Services.tsx` и `SpecialPackages.tsx` подключены общие классы вкладок (`crm-tools-tab*`) и общий контейнер стабильной высоты (`crm-stable-page-height`), плюс единый page-container для special-packages.
5. В `Challenges.tsx` для embedded-режима убрано лишнее ограничение ширины и смягчен контейнер, чтобы секция выглядела ближе к `loyalty`.
6. Обновлены локали `adminPanel/LoyaltyManagement.json` для всех 9 языков (RU/EN/AR/HI/KK/ES/DE/PT/FR) под новые названия и статусы.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Для бонусной программы статусы сущностей (`tier`, `rule`) должны быть управляемы из списка и из формы редактирования.
- Для связанных страниц `services` и `special-packages` использовать единый CSS-паттерн вкладок и одинаковый базовый контейнер, чтобы исключить визуальные скачки.

## 2026-02-12: Восстановление прежнего визуального стиля вкладок (после регрессии UI)

### ПРОБЛЕМА
- После унификации вкладок через кастомные `crm-tools-*` классы визуальный стиль в `services/special-packages` стал хуже: вкладки и общая панель выглядели грубее исходного варианта.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. В `SpecialPackages.tsx` восстановлен прежний кнопочный стиль вкладок на базе `Button` (`default/outline`) с исходными классами.
2. В `Services.tsx` вкладки приведены к этому же стилю, чтобы именно `services` подстроить под `special-packages`.
3. Удалены временные CSS-классы `crm-special-packages-page` и `crm-tools-*`, которые ухудшали внешний вид.
4. Сохранен `crm-stable-page-height` для стабильной высоты страницы без изменения визуального паттерна.

## 2026-02-12: Account бонусная поднавигация и таргетинг промокодов

### ПРОБЛЕМА
1. В `/account/loyalty` отображался синтетический реферальный код (`REF...`), даже когда код не был задан в базе.
2. Подвкладки бонусной зоны (`челленджи/промокоды`) пропадали после перехода, потому что рендерились только внутри `Loyalty`.
3. В WhatsApp/Instagram для бонусной страницы использовалась неуниверсальная логика шаринга (жестко связанная с кодом).
4. В CRM на `/crm/promo-codes` нельзя было настраивать область применения промокода по категориям, услугам и клиентам.

### РЕШЕНИЕ
1. В `backend/api/client_auth.py` убрана генерация fallback-кода `REF{...}`:
   - в `/api/client/dashboard`;
   - в `/api/client/loyalty`.
2. В `AccountPage.tsx` добавлена единая поднавигация бонусной программы на уровне страницы:
   - `Бонусная программа`;
   - `Челленджи`;
   - `Промокоды`;
   - `Специальные предложения`.
   Поднавигация теперь сохраняется при переходах между бонусными разделами.
3. Боковое меню account очищено от дублирующих пунктов (`Промокоды`/`Челленджи` как отдельные элементы) и оставляет бонусный блок единым.
4. В `Loyalty.tsx`:
   - Instagram-кнопка теперь открывает Instagram салона из настроек;
   - WhatsApp формирует текст динамически: с кодом, если код есть, и без кода, если кода нет.
5. `PromoCodesView.tsx` расширен режимами:
   - `promo-codes`;
   - `special-offers` (отдельный `/account/special-offers` на базе активных спецпакетов).
6. CRM промокоды расширены таргетингом:
   - backend: `backend/api/promo_codes.py`, `backend/db/promo_codes.py`;
   - schema: `backend/db/init.py` (поля `target_scope`, `target_category_names`, `target_service_ids`, `target_client_ids`);
   - frontend: `frontend/src/pages/admin/PromoCodes.tsx`, `frontend/src/services/api.ts`.
   Поддержаны режимы: `all`, `categories`, `services`, `clients` с множественным выбором.
7. В клиентском бронировании (`ConfirmStep.tsx`) валидация промокода теперь передает контекст выбранных услуг/категорий/клиента.

### ВАЖНО ПОМНИТЬ
- Поднавигацию связанных бонусных разделов (`/account/loyalty`, `/account/achievements`, `/account/promocodes`, `/account/special-offers`) нужно держать в одном общем контейнере уровня `AccountPage`, а не дублировать внутри отдельных компонентов.
- Промокоды с таргетингом должны валидироваться с контекстом услуги/категории/клиента, иначе ограничения будут обходиться.
